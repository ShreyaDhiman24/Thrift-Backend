            Thrift is a humanitarian effort dedicated to promoting literacy by
            offering "FREE OLD BOOKS" to learners as well as other daily
            necessities that areÂ expensive.
  
            <br /><br />Not only books, but anything else that you believe will be
            useful to others can be included. Along with them, you can buy OR sell
            "SECOND HAND BOOKS" & your handmade works as well.<br /><br />
  
            "Books fan the flames of knowledge and inspire hopes for a better
            future."<br /><br />
  
            A unique component of our work is the identification of adjacent NGOs
            that can place requests for books or other needed items for children,
            thereby benefiting pupils.
            <br /><br />
            Reading is a fantastic way to learn new things or entertain yourself.
            People who desire to promote their works can make the world aware of
            their thoughtful and creative skills.
